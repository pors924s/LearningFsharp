1/17 "Hello World" Application

1/17 at 1.22.38PM User input, read in user's "name"

1/17 at 1.37.09PM Float Manipulation, manipulating digits, big decimal values

1/17 at 1.44.31PM Padding, manipulated spacing between strings

1/17 at 1.49.48PM Mutable values, mutable integer values

1/17 at 1.59.39PM Simple function, created 2 integer parameters and added them together

1/17 at 2.43.27PM Recursive Function, used recursion with a factorial of a parameter

1/18 at 7.10.03PM First list manipulations into the second one, Pipelining list takes even numbers then doubles them, functions within functions

1/24 at 12.19.40PM Manipulations using strings, converting numbers to strings, string length, boolean checks with string etc. 

1/26 at 9.28.47AM Simple while loop with user input to guess the "magic" number

1/26 at 9.37.40AM A bunch of different ways for using for loops, including list iteration

1/26 at 9.52.34AM Conditional with the "match" tool to determine secondary school grade depending on age

1/26 at 10.18.51AM Many different ways to create new lists using cons, list iteration etc.

1/26 at 10.26.18AM Creating lists through for loops, yields and yield!

1/29 at 3.06.48PM Options, for when a function may not return a value

1/29 at 3.17.47PM Tuples, simple tuple, conducted average

1/29 at 3.25.14PM Records, like database entries

1/29 at 4.11.47PM Maps, mapping data finding keys removing items etc.

2/5 at 2.36.02PM First use of F# interactive, practiced function assignment

2/5 at 3.36.06PM Worked on a swap function using tuples and elements of different types

2/5 at 3.45.41PM Differ function to check if hte bool expressions were different, I tried an expresiion within and it actually returned a bool but not sure how it works

2/5 at 3.48.55PM Cadd and csub functions playing around with the function that takes in two elements but only giving it one, put a function that takes two elements within a function that takes two elements but only provided one, did not work

2/6-2/7 Went crazy in F# interactive trying some of the examples from the moodle sources and playing around to see what kind of functions I could make, including List.map, had a lot of struggling with recursion, I was able to recreate one from the moodle resource but could not make it into my own
